# AI-Powered Medical Image Diagnosis

## Overview
A deep learning system for diagnosing medical conditions from images (e.g., X-rays, MRIs). It uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify images and detect abnormalities.

## Features
- Supports image classification for multiple conditions (e.g., pneumonia, fractures).
- Pre-trained CNN models (e.g., ResNet, VGG).
- Visualization of model predictions with heatmaps.
- Processes standard image formats (JPEG, PNG).

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: `tensorflow`, `opencv-python`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`
- GPU (optional, for faster training)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abesh22/Pneumonia-Diagnosis.git
